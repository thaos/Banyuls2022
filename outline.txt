Banyuls 2022: Access to climate data 
Climate Data Store
Earth System Grid Federation

Outline

Quick personnal presentation

Objectives:
	- Show to access climate data, examples with CORDEX data on CDS and ESGF
	- Goal is to give you a quick overview of what's possible to do 
	- Do not hesitate to ask questions 
	- Do not hesitate to share tips
	- All code will be provided: https://github.com/thaos/Banyuls2022
	- I am here until Thursday, so you can come and talk to me afterward (e.g. if you have issue replicated what is presented)

Show CORDEX webpage and data access page:
	https://cordex.org/data-access/
CDS sligtly easier to use but for now, not as complete as ESGF for climate simulations

Data that will be downloaded:
	- GCMs/RCMs: 
		HC-HadGEM2-ES_ICTP-RegCM4-6
		IPSL-IPSL-CM5A-MR_IPSL-WRF381P
	- experiments:
		Historical, RCP45, RCP85
	- variables: 
		10m_wind_speed, 2m_air_temperature, 2m_surface_specific_humidity,
            	maximum_2m_temperature_in_the_last_24_hours, mean_precipitation_flux, minimum_2m_temperature_in_the_last_24_hours


The NetCDF format:
	https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Climate Data Store (CDS):
	- Show CDS homepage
		https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/
	- Quick presentation of the CDS
	- Create an account and connect
	- Show Cordex description and documentation tab
	- Show Cordex download form
	- Give an example to download the 6 variables, one experiment, one rcm, one period.
	- Show the job/queue pannel
	- Show the api request
	- Show documentation: 
		https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to
	- Prepare .dots files and install python package.
	- Submit a request with python script.
	- Use r and/or python to loop over years

Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF):
	- Go to esgf home page
		https://esgf.llnl.gov/
	- Talk about esgf nodes
	- Account creation and  sign in
	- Register to project
	- Search for cordex data for the 6 variables, one experiment, one rcm, one period.
	- Download one file by http.
	- Download several files by wget
	- Show documentation:
		https://esgf.github.io/esgf-user-support/user_guide.html
	- Quick explanation of what is opendap link:
		https://earthdata.nasa.gov/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/opendap
	- Extract data from one netcdf by opendap
	- Parse opendap link from an esgf_search request
